🎬 Content-Based Movie Recommender System This project is a machine learning-powered movie recommender system that suggests films based on their content—such as genres, plot summaries, cast, and keywords. By analyzing similarities between movies, it recommends titles that are most similar to what the user already likes.

🔍 How it works: The system uses techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to compare movie features and generate recommendations.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python

pandas & NumPy

scikit-learn (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)

🎯 Goal: Help users discover movies with similar themes, styles, or storylines to their favorites—no user ratings required!
